# agnostify

> ~237 bytes gzipped

Helper util to replace all href/src URLs with agnostic protocols to support both HTTP/HTTPS.

For example:

If the content passed in contained this original anchor tag `<a href='http://www.argos.co.uk/browse/home-and-garden/cooking-dining-and-kitchen-equipment/tableware/crockery/c:29743/'>crockery</a>` it would become `<a href='//www.argos.co.uk/browse/home-and-garden/cooking-dining-and-kitchen-equipment/tableware/crockery/c:29743/'>crockery</a>` to contain a protocol-agnostic URL.

## Usage

```jsx
import agnostify from '@argos/utils/esnext/agnostify'

agnostify(content)
```
