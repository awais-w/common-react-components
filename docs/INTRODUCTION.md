# CMC Storybook

CMC React components are unobtrusive components shared across all teams.

Whilst we follow many of the standards defined within the Argos teams storybook we currently have a slightly more relaxed stance on browser support - with a current need only to support the latest chrome ( we do still encourage cross-browser support but if there needs to be an exception please discuss this with the team ).

All components are semantically versioned in out maintained Lerna monorepository. Then the modules, helpers and components are pusblished into our private repository then scoped to @cmc/ directory within nexus.

Please read the other documentation below and across the other markdown files to get started with integrating the components into your project / start contributing into the shared project.
