ESSENTIAL
- Use similar structure to BOLT where each component has a package.json
  - uses peerDependencies
  - Create a build script
  - Create publish script
  - Add git hooks for linting / testing etc on build / publish
- Import the BOLT framework so we can use their global colors / buttons ETC
- mixins.scss for our own internal stuff ( would imagine it's covered in bolt )?
- ADD MATERIAL ICON PROPERLY

NICE TO HAVE
- Working knob support
- Support importing SCSS files directly from the component in CHA
- set of primitive component ( title, buttons, headers etc - should be bootstrap? )
- Redux support
